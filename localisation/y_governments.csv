oriental_monarchy_government_desc;Oriental Despotism is the ancient form of government of the fertile crescent in which a single individual formally wields all the power and authority embodying the state. This practice of power rooted in ancient history grants more power to the ruler, but is not well-accepted by populations and rulers accostumed to more freedom. There is no limitation of the number of vassals when those accept oriental despotism, but such a realm is very limited in managing vassals applying other forms of government. Oriental rulers traditionnaly rule from the heart of their capitals rather than from castles, and still practice the looting of neighbooring realms to enrich the despot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
