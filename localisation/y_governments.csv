oriental_monarchy_government_desc;Oriental Despotism is the ancient form of government of the fertile crescent in which a single individual formally wields all the power and authority embodying the state. This practice of power rooted in ancient history grants more power to the ruler, but is not well-accepted by populations and rulers from other civilizations. This government grants easier access to advanced administration and vice-royalties, larger demesne and has no limit on the number of vassals following one of the ancient Persian, Archaic or Mandaean cults. However, this government tends to be rejected by rulers of other religions, who will resent being part of this state. A large state can be maintained in areas with the accustomed to oriental monarchies, but maintaining stability beyond this area will prove challenging. Oriental rulers traditionally rule from the heart of their capitals rather than from castles, and still practice the looting of neighbouring realms to enrich the despot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
