oriental_monarchy_government;Oriental Despotic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
oriental_monarchy_government_desc;Oriental Despotism is the ancient form of government of the fertile crescent in which a single individual formally wields all the power and authority embodying the state. This practice of power rooted in ancient history grants more power to the ruler, but is not well-accepted by populations and rulers from other civilizations. This government grants easier access to advanced administration and vice-royalties, larger demesne and has no limit on the number of vassals following one of the ancient Persian, Archaic or Mandaean cults. However, this government tends to be rejected by rulers of other religions, who will resent being part of this state. Oriental despots still practice the looting of neighbouring realms to enrich the despot.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
classical_government;Classical;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
classical_government_desc;The classical Roman and Hellenistic form of government emphasizes enlightened rule by the ruler. In the classical graeco-roman political model, the ruler is less involved in day-to-day decision-making, hampering centralization and limiting personal domain. At the same time, the realm’s administration is more developed and maintains the graeco-roman legal system, preventing realm split upon successions. Prestigious rulers keep up the tradition of advancing civilization by founding new cities in their realm. On the battlefield, graeco-roman pikemen and heavy infantry remain unmatched, heirs the Hellenistic phalanxes and of the Roman legions.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
anarchist_government;Anarchist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
anarchist_government_desc;Realms following a populist soul-religion may descend in anarchy if the ruler lacks authority. Offensive armies do not require maintainance, but anarchist realms are difficult to handle. Anarchist vassals tend to reject authority, but will tolerate cooperation with lieges following the same anarchist utopia.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
demagogic_government;Demagogic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
demagogic_government_desc;In a Demagogic government, the ruler uses exceptional charisma and organization skills to play with the masses' souls and minds. This allows channeling the people's utopic desires and political passions into a effective cult of personality, imposing a very strict control over vassals and forcing them to comply with the strictest requirements. As a result, the ruler yields immense power, but this form of government is tied to the current ruler and requires maintaining constantly a very high level of personal authority. Beware, vassals who cannot express discontent too openly may seek other ways to advance their agendas…\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
mystic_government;Mystic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
mystic_government_desc;In a Mystic government, the ruler uses exceptional spiritual aura, doctrinal knowledge and organization skills to capture the clergy's souls and minds. This allows channeling the clergy's far-reaching influence on society into an effective cult of personality. The increased legitimacy and using the clergy's well-structured organization makes it possible for the ruler to revoke vassal titles much more easily. The mystic overlord furthmore imposes a very strict control over clerical vassals, forcing them to comply with the strictest requirements in terms of tax and levy.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
absolutist_government;Absolutist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
absolutist_government_desc;An Absolutist government is a monarchical form of government for realms following a religion of Statist soul, in which the monarch uses the spiritual system to claim absolute power among his or her people. This form of government requires the ruler to have exceptionally strong political authority, diplomacy and intrigue skills to dominate the State apparatus in order to impose an elaborate ideology on the realm, a set of ideas that gives meaning and direction to the whole society. The absolut monarch can revoke vassal titles arbitrarily. The omniscient state forces high requirements on vassals in terms of tax and levy. It helps the monarch to uncover hostile plots. This may prove vital, as vassals who cannot express discontent too openly may seek other ways to advance their agendas…\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
