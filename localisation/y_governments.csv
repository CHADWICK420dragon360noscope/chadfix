oriental_monarchy_government_desc;Oriental Despotism is the ancient form of government of the fertile crescent in which a single individual formally wields all the power and authority embodying the state. This practice of power rooted in ancient history grants more power to the ruler, but is not well-accepted by populations and rulers from other civilizations. This government grants easier access to advanced administration and vice-royalties, larger demesne and has no limit on the number of vassals following one of the ancient Persian, Archaic or Mandaean cults. However, this government tends to be rejected by rulers of other religions, who will resent being part of this state. Oriental despots still practice the looting of neighbouring realms to enrich the despot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
classical_government;Classical;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
classical_government_desc;The classical Roman and Hellenistic form of government emphasizes enlightened rule by the ruler. The classical practice of ruling through client kings is, to some extent, similar to feudalism. In the classical graeco-roman political model, the ruler is less involved in day-to-day decision-making, hampering centralization and limiting personal domain. At the same time, the realm’s administration is more developed and maintains the graeco-roman legal system, preventing realm split upon successions. Rulers keep up the tradition of ruling from urban centers rather than from feudal castles. On the battlefield, graeco-roman pikemen and heavy infantry remain unmatched, heirs the Hellenistic phalanxes and of the Roman legions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

anarchist_government_desc;Realms following a populist soul-religion may descend in anarchy if the ruler lacks authority. Offensive armies do not require maintainance, but anarchist realms are difficult to handle. Anarchist vassals tend to reject authority, but will tolerate cooperation with lieges following the same anarchist utopia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
