Tons of credit goes to the original team who made Lux Invicta in the early days of CK2
Shaytana, chief among them, was a creative vision who devoted himself to making a total overhaul
with complete vision, creativity, and lots of time.

As such, there are some still important people which need to be mentioned as keeping the Light of
Lux around through the dark years:

- riknap, richvh, Numahr, DarkGamma, tsf4

The community of fans of the mod have time again shown themselves to be true heroes of the Light

- Foffy123 (for finding critical bugs which were planted by the Darkness himself)
- Many others, who if name themselves can be listed here.


Lux Invicta would be nowhere if the fans did not keep playing the mod, and so we give our thanks to
you all, and help us keep the darkness at bay by playing this glorious mod which Shaytana so
gracefully gave us.
