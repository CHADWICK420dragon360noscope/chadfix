- For quattara, I gave the county to the brother of the Banu Rassi emir. Muhammad ibn Djafar was sent here by his brother to watch the western frontiers of the emirate.

- For Gizeh, it's Muammar Muammarid (egyptian_arabic/kharijite). He is a peasant leader, some years ago the emir make a deal with his peasant army: they can built their communal farms under the rule of their leader, but have to assure themselves the protection of the county.

- For Al-alamayn, it's Fahd Fahdid (maghreb_arabic/shiite). He is a loyal soldier of the Al-Fihri emirate who was send here to make sure that the local population stay under control.

- For Syrte, it's Berkan Berkanid (berber/amanai). He is a local merchant from Leptis Magna.

- For Meninx (or ouled_nail in Tripolitania), it's an obvious reference, Aemilianus Scipio (roman/mithra). He is a great war chief claiming to be the descendant of this legendary Gens. Maybe a war against Carthage will help in his ascension...

- For Kairouan, it's Tariq Tariqid (maghreb_arabic/ilm_islam). He was the regent of the emirate when the Aghlabid Emir was still young and he earned from that the most prosperous county in the realm.

- For Mahdia, I gave the title to Gelimer Gelimerid the cousin of the "Leper King". Huneric IV killed most of the claimant to the throne, but Gelimer escape from this trap soon enough. He went to Mahdia in the south of the kingdom and made it a stronghold, where he gather support for a regicide against the "Leper King".

- For Bizerte, it's Theuderic of Carthage (vandal/arian). He is in charge of the frontier garrison and who know what this cynical man will do when a revolt will erupt?

- For Bejaila, I made a brother to the king Hiempsal of Numidia. Yugurthen (berber/donatist) is a loyal servant of his brother, even if some would say that he's better suited for the crown.

- For Constantine, it's Tifan Tifans (berber/donatist). He is the zealous protector of the Primate, and will die if necessary for the head of the church.

- For Gurma, it's Kamandjan Siby (akan/yoruba). I wanted to make a little reference to Siby: a little village not so far from Gurma. In the Epic of Sundiata Kamandjan Camara, a mythical king from Siby, break a mountain and gather many king for the great battle of Kirina.

- For Aoudaghost, it's Massinissa Massinissas (berber/gurzil). He is one of the berber warlord installed in Ghana.

- For Fuka Lolong, it's Mamoudou Mamoudou (fur/sol_sahara). He was choose by the priests to be the keeper of this holy site of the Dulukefan faith.

- For Akordat, it's Oromo Oromo (ethiopian/sol_tsahay). A local administrator without great ambitions.
