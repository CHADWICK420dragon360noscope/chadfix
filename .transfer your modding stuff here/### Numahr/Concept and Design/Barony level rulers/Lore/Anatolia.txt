-For Nikaea, it's Peithon para Darieium (jupiter/greek). The kind but generally middling lord of Nikaea who has only the love of his people to protect him from his twin brother and gained his post due to his skill as a judge.

-For Prusa, it's Markos para Darieium (jupiter/greek). Cruel and selfish, the count of Prusa gained his post due to his martial skill but his array of character flaws and his murder of his own father makes him unpopular with his peers and his own brother.

-For Tyana, Ioincos as Tyana (mithra_sol/galatian). This competent and popular general serves his king well for now, but will his skills make him a dangerous opponent to the king in the future?

-For Nyssa, it's Iaros para Artake (mithra_sol/galatian). A competent but unpopular administrator appointed by his King. His post is secure in his King's court but is far less so at home.

-For Tell Bashir, it's Hamazasp ve Tzimisca (monothelite/armenian). Charismatic and popular but plagued by his poor health, this tiny diplomat's greatest opponent is his own body.

-For Karin, it's Hovsep ve Karin (melkite/armenian). A commander and soldier by career, but his actual skills push him in another direction; that of a diplomat.

-For Mesopotamia, it's Sames ve Tercan (graeco_roman/armenian). This native Armenian administrator converted to gain his post and currently only cares about keeping his current place, but he may wish to serve a fellow Armenian.

-For Melitene, it's Diogenes apo Melitene (luwian/hellenistic). This administrator may be fairly competent in ruling, but he really cares about religion and wishes to serve a Luwian King deeply.

For Adana, it's Davit ve Mamistra (docetist/armenian). This diplomat is very competent but is beginning to be caught up in the prestige and benefits of his skill.

-For Teluch, it's Avag ve Perre (docetist/armenian). This aspiring spymaster is well suited to his chosen career, but the intrigue is beginning to take a toll on his mind.

-For Theodosiopolis, it's Zenon Kigali (roman_imperial/greek). This foolish commander is competent in war but at home he is led by the nose.
