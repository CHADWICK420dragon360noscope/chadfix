- For Lisbona, I choose to make a brother to the king Martim II of Lusitania, Viriathus (lusitanian/endovellico). He's a great commander and an ambitious, maybe this man will rises using his sword like his ancestor...

- For Coimbra, it's Bellovellaunus Vimaranes (lusitanian/mithra_christ). I make him mithra-christ like is already in place neighbour, the local population follow the lusitanian cult in the kingdom, but the military in the north of the kingdom seems to still follow the new cult bring by Martim I. These mithra-christians lived in front of the germanic invaders, life is harsh but it's thanks to war that Bellovellaunus became the new ruler of Coimbra, to protect the frontier. Maybe he will be the bringer of a new era for the kingdom...

- For Silves, it's Beler ve Silves (alan/hurufi), it's just an humble local diplomat working for his lord.

- For Denia, it's Valetignatus Sertorius (lusitanian/endovellico). He is the last representative of the lusitanians auxiliaries who worked for centuries in the Roman Legion of Hispania. Valetignatus claim that he's the descendant of Sertorius, a great general of the Roman Republic who built a stronghold during a Civil War in Hispania and was a advocate of peaceful cohabitation with the Hispanic tribes. Actually, the only task of these Lusitanians soldiers is to keep the southern frontier of the Exarchate of Valencia safe; but Lusitanians are tired to work for a weak Roman state in the middle of a chaotic Hispania...

- For Aracena, I gave the county to the son of the Abbadid Emir. He is in front of the Umayyad splendor, and his father want is son to take some experience before taking the crown of the emirate.

- For Algeciras, it's Ahmad Ahmadid (andalusian_arabic/Ilm_islam), an humble servant of the King of Tingis and a great administrator, but he's in a hard situation. He is the friend of both the king and his brother: the two of them hate each others from a long time, especially when the little brother in his Andalusian fief convert to 'Ilmi Islam. Ahmad will probably have to make choice between he's two friend when a revolt will erupt...

- For Almeria, it's Gelimer of Urci (vandal/sunni) a vandal iman who converted the county to the good faith, and was rewarded for that by the Duke of Granada.

- For Empuries, i wanted to make a little reference: Dominic de Guzman (catalan/catholic). In the world of Lux Invicta, "Saint" Dominic is probably the greatest foe of the Cathar faith. He is a great theologian but also a cruel man. he will try to eradicate the Cathar heresy by any mean necessary. His little army is know as the "Inquisitors", a troop of catholic fanatics who go on a rampage against heretics and non-believers every day...

- For Carcassonne, the count is Abraham Carcassonne (romanogothic/cathar). A local soldiers who watch the southern frontier for the Duke.

- For Foix, it's Alienor de Foix (occitan/cathar). Another reference. Thanks to the open-minded cathar faith, this skilled and ambitious woman earn this county some years ago. Every night, she dream of an unified Aquitaine under her rule...

- For Armagnac, it's Julian of Armagnac (visigothic/arian). The duke of Vasconia gave this awful county in front of the heretics to this young and unexperimented courtesan. Who know if Julian will prove his worth with time?

- For Agen, I gave the county to the brother of the King of Aquitaine. Willelmus was not in good term with is brother, so he took control of this unprotected fief who was in the hand of his brother. Maybe this move is the first step for a bloody regicide...

- For Lemdiyya, I gave the county to the son of the Hammadid Emir, for the same reason as Aracena.

- For Biskra, it's Aheyyad Aheyyads (berber/mutazil). A lunatic Iman who earn support from the local population.

- For Tissemsilt and Hanyan, it's Ziri Zirid and Yuba Yubaid (berber/ibadi). They keep the frontier safe from the nomadic horde of the south. The two of them have many weakness, but they balance each other.
