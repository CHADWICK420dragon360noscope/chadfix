Platonic Vedanta is a Local Neoplatonist faith of Scholarly soul with strong Gnostic influences. While it is part of the Neoplatonic school of thought, there is nothing "new" about Platonic Vedanta. Its creator, the Academy-trained Keralan philosopher Guru Shankara, believed that the Holy Vedas had already laid out all the arguments needed for the conclusions of the Neoplatonic thinkers, thousands of years before Guru Plato. Platonic Vedantists, like their Western cousins, believe that the world of experience is illusion, and that all consciousness is inseparable from The One. The Vedantic version of The One, Nigurna Brahman, is completely without attributes, without motive, without action, and without reaction. All aspects of the Self that do not fit this description are part of the illusion of experience, or Maya. Shankara specifically discouraged the ritual worship of or literal belief in gods, for such practices implied a separation between the Self and Nigurna Brahman. The idealized goal of a Vedantist is to see past the folds of illusion until all that is left of the Self is Nigurna Brahman itself, ceasing to experience the dream. Those who take this path seclude themselves in the Matha monasteries established by Shankara. Most, however, settle for spreading their perspective in the hopes that recognition of the One-ness of all beings will encourage greater cooperation, empathy, and shared prosperity between Hellenic and Indian communities in the region, leading by example as scholars and teachers across India and as leaders of its greatest centers of learning.
